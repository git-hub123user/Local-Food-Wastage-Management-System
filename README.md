# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System
This project is a Streamlit and PostgreSQL application tackling food waste. It connects restaurants and households with surplus food to those in need (individuals, NGOs). The system allows food listing/claiming, manages data via an SQL database, and analyzes wastage trends. Goal: efficient food redistribution and social good.
